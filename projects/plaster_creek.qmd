In collaboration with plaster creek research student, we worked on using statistical modeling to analyze the effects of rain gardens on soil contaminants.

To analyze the effects of rain gardens on soil contaminants, we fitted generalized linear models (GLM) with contaminants Chloride, Iron, and Zinc as a function of rain garden age, percentage soil organic content, and pH. Phosphate and Chloride were modeled using gamma family and log link function while Iron and Zinc were modeled using binomial family with logit link function. Random effect of sample nested in sites is included. All models are fitted using R statistics in R studio. 

Because this project is in collaboration with a research project that's ongoing publication, the workbook is not shown here.
